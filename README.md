# TCHUKA-RUMA-Solitaire-Game
Objective: Get all the pieces into the ruma section. 

Game Setup:
Ruma is played on a board with 4 sections and an additional ruma section. Each containing a 2 pieces. 

Gameplay:

Sowing the Seeds:

The player takes turns picking up pieces from any section on the board.
Beginning from the chosen section, the player sows the counters one by one into each consecutive section, moving towards the Ruma section.

Ruma Square:

If the last piece is successfully dropped into the Ruma section, the player earns an extra turn. They must then choose a new starting section and continue sowing the seeds.

Empty Space Challenge:

If the last piece lands in an empty space, the game ends, and the player loses. Empty spaces represent unproductive soil, bringing an unfortunate conclusion to the sowing journey.

Occupied Space Bonus:

If the last piece falls into a section already occupied by one or more pieces, the player picks up all the pieces from that square and continues sowing. This action can lead to extended chains and increased scores.
